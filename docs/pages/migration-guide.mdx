# Migration Guide

## Migrating from `v2` to `v3`

When migrating from version 2 of this library to version 3, there are a couple
of breaking changes that you need to keep in mind. We will go through all of
them and we will also look at how to refactor your code for migration in
different cases

### Yandex.Maps Modules Strict Defaults

This library heavily utilizes Yandex.Maps module system, as covered in
["Basic Principles: Modular Approach"](/basic-principles/modular-approach). That
means that you don't get any control elements, balloons, hints or additional
Yandex.Maps APIs right away. Instead, you need to specify what additional
modules you need when you are working with Yandex.Maps.

Let's look at examples. This is how you would get zoom control on a Map element
in `v2`.

```jsx
<Map
  state={{
    zoom: 9,
    center: [55.76, 37.64],
    controls: ['zoomControl'],
  }}
/>;
```

Good thing about this example is that you just specify zoom control in controls
section and boom, you have it on your map. Bad thing is that this is possible
just because by default Yandex.Maps API will download a lot of separate parts of
itself, disregarding if they are used or not. You might be using only zoom
control, but the library will download all the other controls also.

So how to enable zoom control on your map in this case? There are a couple of
options here:

1. Use ZoomControl component:

```jsx
<Map
  state={{
    zoom: 9,
    center: [55.76, 37.64],
  }}
>
  <ZoomControl />
</Map>;
```

2. Specify zoom control in special modules property:

```jsx
<Map
  state={{
    zoom: 9,
    center: [55.76, 37.64],
    controls: ['zoomControl'],
  }}
  modules={['control.ZoomControl']}
/>;
```

3. Use Yandex.Maps `query.load` parameter in YMaps provider component:

```jsx
<YMaps query={{ load: 'control.ZoomControl' }}>
  <Map
    state={{
      zoom: 9,
      center: [55.76, 37.64],
      controls: ['zoomControl'],
    }}
  />
</YMaps>;
```

> `INFO` Yandex.Maps API default value for this option is `package.full`.
> Setting `query.load` to `'package.full'` will set this library to the mode
> that is completely matching the default Yandex.Maps API behavior and will opt
> you out of using modular approach

Keep in mind that "use component" approach is not possible for everything, for
example hints and balloons are a special case in Yandex.Maps API in general, so
if you need hint or balloon on the screen, please use the second option:

```jsx
<Placemark
  geometry={[55.684758, 37.738521]}
  modules={['geoObject.addon.balloon', 'geoObject.addon.hint']}
/>;
```

Or create a new component so you don't need to repeat yourself:

```jsx
const PlacemarkWithAddons = props => (
  <Placemark
    {...props}
    modules={['geoObject.addon.balloon', 'geoObject.addon.hint']}
  />
);
```

### `onApiAvaliable` is removed from the library

`onApiAvaliable` is an event callback, that was available on the `YMaps`
provider component to give you access to ymaps api client instance. That event
callback is removed from the library. Instead of using it, you can use `onLoad`
event callback on any Yandex.Map object, that is rendered on the screen.

Below is an example of using `onApiAvaliable` in `v2`.

```jsx
<YMaps onApiAvaliable={ymaps => console.log(ymaps)}>
  <Map />
</YMaps>;
```

Now you can use `onLoad` event callback on components to get access to `ymaps`
instance

```jsx
<YMaps>
  <Map onLoad={ymaps => console.log(ymaps)} />
</YMaps>;
```

Why no `onLoad` event on the `Provider` itself? Reason is that starting from
`v3` this library wouldn't start loading yandex maps api unless there is at
least one maps related component is rendered on the screen. That means that
providing onLoad event would be a little bit confusing, as YMaps provider is not
the one responsible for this anymore.

Another way of getting to ymaps instance is to use `withYMaps` higher-order
component.

Let's try to do the same task: using ymaps to create custom template layout
factory the old way and with two new approaches.

First, with `v2`:

```jsx
class CustomTemplate extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = { template: null };

    this.createTemplateLayoutFactory = ymaps => {
      if (ymaps && !this.state.template) {
        this.setState({
          template: ymaps.templateLayoutFactory.createClass(
            '<h3>Hello from custom template!</h3>'
          ),
        });
      }
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <YMaps onApiAvaliable={this.createTemplateLayoutFactory}>
        <Map state={{ center: [0, 0], zoom: 9 }}>
          {this.state.template && (
            <Placemark
              geometry={[0, 0]}
              options={{ balloonContentLayout: this.state.template }}
            />
          )}
        </Map>
      </YMaps>
    );
  }
}
```

It will be almost the same thing with `v3` and `onLoad` event callback. Move
event handler to Map component and don't forget to load additional required
modules (`templateLayoutFactory` and `geoObject.addon.balloon` in this case):

```jsx
class CustomTemplate extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = { template: null };

    this.createTemplateLayoutFactory = ymaps => {
      if (ymaps && !this.state.template) {
        this.setState({
          template: ymaps.templateLayoutFactory.createClass(
            '<h3>Hello from custom template!</h3>'
          ),
        });
      }
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <YMaps>
        <Map
          // Event handler was moved from onApiAvaliable on YMaps to onLoad on Map
          onLoad={this.createTemplateLayoutFactory}
          state={{ center: [0, 0], zoom: 9 }}
          // We are also loading `templateLayoutFactory` additionally to Map
          modules={['templateLayoutFactory']}
        >
          {this.state.template && (
            <Placemark
              geometry={[0, 0]}
              options={{ balloonContentLayout: this.state.template }}
              // And balloon addon for all geo objects
              modules={['geoObject.addon.balloon']}
            />
          )}
        </Map>
      </YMaps>
    );
  }
}
```

Let's try a little bit more fancy approach with `withYMaps` HOC. We will create
a component that loads `templateLayoutFactory`, creates templates and passes
them to its children with render prop (children as a function) React pattern.

```jsx
// @live
class TemplateProvider extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { template: null };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({
      template: this.props.ymaps.templateLayoutFactory.createClass(
        '<h3>Hello from custom template!</h3>'
      ),
    });
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.children({ template: this.state.template });
  }
}

const ConnectedTemplateProvider = withYMaps(TemplateProvider, true, [
  'templateLayoutFactory',
]);

const CustomTemplate = () => (
  <YMaps>
    <ConnectedTemplateProvider>
      {({ template }) => (
        <Map state={{ center: [0, 0], zoom: 9 }}>
          <Placemark
            geometry={[0, 0]}
            options={{ balloonContentLayout: template }}
            // Load balloon addon for all geo objects
            modules={['geoObject.addon.balloon']}
          />
        </Map>
      )}
    </ConnectedTemplateProvider>
  </YMaps>
);

render(CustomTemplate);
```

Now we have reusable component that we can compose with any geo object on any
map we have and give it easy access to custom Yandex.Maps templates. You can
also notice that we don't need to manually check if ymaps is available or if
template is ready, all this logic is either handled by HOC or our
`TemplateProvider` method

### Geometry Prop

Starting from `v3` this library follows Yandex.Maps API more closely. For
multiple geo objects that are derived from GeoObject that means changing how
geometry is passed to the Yandex.Maps API instance. Instead of providing an
object with geometry and coordinates, you should use arrays of numbers as per
Yandex.Maps documentation.

```jsx
// v2
<Placemark geometry={{ coordinates: [0, 0] }}>

// v3
<Placemark geometry={[0, 0]}>
```

### Control component

Control component is removed from the library as it is not part of Yandex.Maps
API. All supported Yandex.Maps controls are exported from the library in v3, use
them instead.

```jsx
// v2
<Control type="RouteButton" />

// v3
<RouteButton />
```
