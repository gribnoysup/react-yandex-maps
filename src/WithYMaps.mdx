# `withYMaps` Helper

This library comes with a HOC creator function that can give any component in
your application an access to Yandex.Maps API.

Creating HOC with this function will give your components access to Yandex.Maps
API object. You can use this API in your components in various ways.

Keep in mind that by default `react-yandex-maps` loads only the small core of
Yandex.Maps API, so if you need access to something that is not included in the
core of Yandex.Maps, you need to explicitly specify this. There are several ways
to do this: with the third argument of the `withYMaps` HOC (as shown in the
example above), with the `modules` prop of connected component, or by providing
required module in `query.load` prop of `<YMaps />` component.

In the example below we are creating a HOC that will load Yandex.Maps Route API,
and them we are using this API inside our `LengthPrinter` component to display
route length on the screen.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const LengthPrinter = React.useMemo(() => {
      return ({ ymaps, route }) => {
        const [routeLength, setRouteLength] = React.useState(null);

        React.useEffect(() => {
          let canceled = false;

          if (ymaps && ymaps.route) {
            ymaps.route(route).then(route => {
              if (!canceled) {
                setRouteLength(route.getHumanLength().replace('&#160;', ' '));
              }
            });
          }

          return () => (canceled = true);
        }, [ymaps, ...route]);

        return routeLength ? (
          <p>
            The route from <strong>{route[0]}</strong> to{' '}
            <strong>{route[1]}</strong> is <strong>{routeLength}</strong> long
          </p>
        ) : (
          <p>Loading route...</p>
        );
      };

}, []);

    const ConnectedLengthPrinter = React.useMemo(() => {
      return withYMaps(LengthPrinter, true, ['route'])
    }, [LengthPrinter]);

    return (
      <YMaps query={{ lang: 'en_RU' }}>
        <ConnectedLengthPrinter route={['Moscow, Russia', 'Berlin, Germany']} />
      </YMaps>
    );

}}

</Playground>

Don't forget that any component from this library (even those created with the
HOC creator function) need to be wrapped in `YMaps` provider component.
